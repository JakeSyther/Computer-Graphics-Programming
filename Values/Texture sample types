In computer graphics, a texture is a 2D image or data structure used to add detail or color to 3D models or 2D images.
Textures are sampled in a shader using a texture sampler type. In general, there are several texture sampler types,
each with its own unique characteristics and use cases. Here is an overview of the most common texture sampler types:

Sampler1D: A 1D texture sampler that is used to sample 1D textures. 1D textures are often used for things like color gradients and other 1D data.

Sampler2D: A 2D texture sampler that is used to sample 2D textures. 2D textures are the most commonly used texture type and are used for things like images,
           maps, and other 2D data.
           
Sampler3D: A 3D texture sampler that is used to sample 3D textures. 3D textures are used to create volumetric effects and to store data in a 3D space.

SamplerCube: A cube texture sampler that is used to sample cube maps. Cube maps are often used for things like reflections and refractions, skyboxes,
             and other cube-shaped data.

Sampler2DArray: A 2D array texture sampler that is used to sample multiple 2D textures in an array.
                This is useful for things like sprite sheets, where multiple images are stored in a single texture.

SamplerCubeArray: A cube array texture sampler that is used to sample multiple cube maps in an array.
                  This is useful for things like skyboxes that have multiple layers.
                  
                  
Each texture sampler type has its own set of methods and properties for sampling textures in a shader.
For example, the Sampler2D type has a method called tex2D that is used to sample a 2D texture.
Other texture sampler types have similar methods for sampling textures.

When using textures in a shader, it is important to consider the texture sampler type and its associated properties and methods
to ensure that the texture is sampled correctly and efficiently.
