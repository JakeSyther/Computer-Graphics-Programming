In computer graphics, a vertex is a point in 2D or 3D space that defines a specific location on a geometric object, such as a polygon or a mesh.
Vertices are commonly used to define the corners or edges of shapes, and they can be connected together to form a complete object.

In 3D graphics programming, vertices are often represented as a set of three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z) that describe the location of a point in space. 
In addition to the spatial position, vertices can also store additional information, such as the color or texture coordinates of the point.

When rendering a 3D object, vertices are typically used to define the shape and position of the object,
and they are processed by the graphics pipeline to transform the object into the final image that is displayed on the screen.
This processing involves applying various transformations, such as scaling, rotation, and translation, to the vertices to position
them correctly in space and create the desired visual effect.

In computer graphics programming, vertices are an important concept and are used extensively in 3D graphics and game development.
Understanding how vertices work and how to use them can be a key component of creating complex and visually impressive graphics in games and other applications.
