In computer graphics and game development, a pipeline refers to the sequence of steps that are used to process graphics data and generate the final output that is 
displayed on the screen. The graphics pipeline typically consists of several stages, each of which performs a specific set of operations on the input data.

The exact details of the graphics pipeline can vary depending on the hardware and software platform,
but some of the common stages in a typical graphics pipeline include:

1. Input Assembly: This stage reads in the raw data for the 3D objects that are to be rendered, including vertex data, texture data, and other information.

2. Vertex Processing: In this stage, the individual vertices in the input data are transformed, manipulated, and optimized to create the final 3D objects
   that will be rendered.
   
3. Rasterization : Rasterisation or rasterization is the task of taking an image described in a vector graphics format
   and converting it into a raster image. The rasterized image may then be displayed on a computer display,
   video display or printer, or stored in a bitmap file format.
   
4. Pixel Processing : In this stage, each individual pixel in the 2D images is processed to determine
   its final color and other properties, such as transparency and depth.
   
5. Output Merger: This stage combines all of the processed pixels and creates the final output image that is sent to the display device.


Understanding the graphics pipeline is important for graphics programmers and game developers
because it can help them optimize their code and create more efficient and visually impressive graphics.
By understanding how the different stages of the pipeline work and how they interact with each other,
developers can create more efficient rendering algorithms and achieve better performance and visual quality
in their applications.
