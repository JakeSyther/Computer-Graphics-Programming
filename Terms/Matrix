In computer graphics, a matrix is a mathematical structure that is used to represent transformations of 2D or 3D geometric objects,
such as rotation, scaling, and translation. Matrices are often used in computer graphics programming to perform these transformations efficiently and accurately.

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers that is used to represent a linear transformation. A 2D matrix typically has 3 rows and 3 columns,
while a 3D matrix typically has 4 rows and 4 columns. The values in the matrix represent the scaling, rotation,
and translation factors that are applied to the object being transformed.

In computer graphics programming, matrices are used to transform 3D points and vectors from one coordinate system to another. 
For example, when rendering a 3D object on a 2D screen, the object must be projected onto the 2D screen using a matrix transformation. 
Matrices are also used to transform objects in space, such as rotating or scaling a 3D model in a game.

Matrices are an important concept in computer graphics programming and are used extensively in 3D graphics and game development.
Understanding how matrices work and how to use them can be a key component of creating complex and visually impressive graphics in games and other applications.
