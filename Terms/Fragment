In computer graphics, a fragment is a small piece of a larger graphical element that is being rendered on the screen.
A fragment is essentially a single pixel on the screen, and it represents the basic unit of processing in many graphics systems.

When an image is rendered on the screen, it is typically broken down into a series of fragments that correspond to the pixels that make up the image. 
Each fragment contains information about the color, depth, and other attributes of the pixel it represents.

Fragments are typically processed by the graphics hardware using specialized programs called shaders. 
Fragment shaders are programs that are designed to run on each fragment and determine the final color and other attributes of the pixel that the fragment represents. 
These shaders can perform complex calculations and use various techniques to simulate lighting, shadows, textures,
and other effects that contribute to the final appearance of the image on the screen.

Overall, fragments are an important concept in computer graphics because they provide a way to break down complex images into smaller 
units that can be efficiently processed by the graphics hardware. By working with fragments, graphics systems can render complex images 
with high levels of detail and realism, while still maintaining smooth performance and high frame rates.
